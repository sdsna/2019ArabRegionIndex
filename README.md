# 2019 Arab Region SDG Index and Dashboards Report

The *Arab Region SDG Index and Dashboards* are intended as a tool for governments and other stakeholders to measure progress on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and to highlight gaps in both implementation and data. The 2019 Arab Region SDG Index is the first in its kind and is therefore also intended as a conversation-opener about priority areas, policies and actions.
